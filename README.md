For this project, I choose to make a simple scientific calculator application using Visual Basic.NET to show just how simple and easy it is to learn and make programs.
Visual Basic is a very simple programming language that makes it simple to construct a graphical user interface. Compared to more complex languages, its functionality is consequently constrained.
